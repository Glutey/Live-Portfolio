Live working portfolio.
This site has been created as a landing page for displaying any and all projects I create or have part in. 
It's purpose is to show off my technical ability, commitment and style for future employers and/or collaborators.
It contains a usable navigation bar, clickable menus, adaptive content and accessible.  Containing information about me as a person, a photograph, links to some work I have already done.  Services I would aim to offer and contact information.
